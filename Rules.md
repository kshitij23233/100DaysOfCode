Main Commitment
I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
Start Date : Jan 1st 2022

Additional Rules
I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
I am allowed to take a 1 day break , but I canno't take more than 1 day of break in a row , also only one break per week is allowed.
If I ever have to take a break longer than a day (because of Sem Exams , sickness , etc). I will cover up for those days by adding 2 extra days to the challenge.
