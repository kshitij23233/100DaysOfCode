# 100DaysOfCode
I am taking up the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge from Jan 4th 2022. Under this challenge , I have to code for atleast an hour every day for 100 days. Here are the Rules which I will be following for the challenge.

I will be maintaining a Log in this repo, so that anyone can track my progress. All my work will be linked in Log.

My main motivation behind taking up the #100DaysOfCodingChallenge is to increase my consistency. As it is famously said "Consistency is the key to success." My goal is to learn to work hard consistantly from this challenge. I will give my best efforts to complete the challenge without any breaks. I would also try to code more than the minimum time of one hour for most of the days. In case I absolutely have to take a break longer than a day in regards of Sem Exam , Sickness of any other valid reason , I will add 2 extra days to the challenge for each day I've missed. Feel free to give any sugestions you have for me. All suggestions are welcome.
